## Competitive Positioning

### Oncor vs Full-Time Estimator

**Full-time estimator cost:**
- Salary: $55,000 - $75,000/year
- Benefits: +25-35%
- Software/tools: $3,000-8,000/year
- **Total: ~$80,000 - $110,000/year**

**Oncor breakeven:**
- At $500/estimate average = 160-220 estimates/year
- At 3-4 estimates/week = contractor breaks even
- Below that threshold, Oncor saves money

### Key Differentiators

1. **Speed** — 24-48 hour turnaround standard
2. **Local knowledge** — El Paso labor rates, suppliers, conditions
3. **Accuracy** — Concrete-focused expertise
4. **Flexibility** — Scale up/down with bid volume
5. **Technology** — Digital takeoff tools, professional deliverables

## Pricing Psychology Tips

1. **Bundle services** — Full estimate vs. just takeoff creates perceived value
2. **Free first estimate** — Conversion tool, builds trust
3. **Volume discounts** — 10% off for 5+ projects/month commitment
4. **Rush premium** — Always charge for rush (signals value)
5. **Annual contracts** — Flat monthly fee for X estimates = steady income
