# Target Contractor Research Guide

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### Size & Revenue
- **Sweet spot:** $1M - $20M annual revenue
- **Employee count:** 10-100 people
- **Why:** Big enough to have steady bid flow, small enough to not have dedicated estimating department

### Characteristics
- Active bid submitter (3+ bids/month)
- Working on commercial or larger residential
- Growth-minded (wants more bids, not capacity constrained)
- Technology-friendly (uses email, can send PDFs)

### Red Flags (Avoid)
- Too small: Owner does everything, no budget for services
- Too big: In-house estimating team, established processes
- Residential-only custom work: Too variable, hard to standardize
