# Cold Email Templates for Oncor Estimating

## Template 1: Casual / Friendly

**Subject:** Quick question about your estimating backlog

---

Hey [First Name],

Saw [Company Name] is doing some solid work in [City/Area]. Quick question — are you ever backlogged on estimates when multiple bid requests hit at once?

I'm JFS, I run Oncor Estimating. We specialize in concrete takeoffs and estimating for contractors like you. The idea is simple: you send us plans, we send back accurate quantities and a bid-ready estimate within 24-48 hours.

Most of our clients use us when they're slammed with bid requests or just want to focus on running jobs instead of sitting at a desk measuring plans.

If that sounds useful, I'd love to do a free sample estimate on one of your upcoming projects so you can see the quality firsthand.

No pressure either way — just thought it might help.

## Template 3: Money-Saving Focus

**Subject:** Cutting 10-15% off your estimating costs

---

[First Name],

What if you could bid more jobs without adding headcount?

I'm JFS from Oncor Estimating. We help concrete contractors like [Company Name] bid more work without the overhead of a full-time estimator.

**The math:**
- Full-time estimator: $60-80K/year + benefits
- Oncor: Pay only when you have bids to submit

Most of our clients see 10-15% savings on estimating costs while actually *increasing* their bid volume.

Here's what we deliver:
- Detailed takeoffs (slabs, footings, walls, grade beams)
- Material quantities + waste factors
- Labor estimates based on local El Paso rates
- Professional estimate packages ready for your bid

**I'll do your first estimate free** so you can see exactly what you're getting.

Interested? Just reply with a set of plans and your deadline.
